## Hi there 👋

I am Sudarshan Regmi, a PhD student at Dartmouth College, fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Andrew Campbell. My current research focuses on the application of large language models to time series modality. Previously, I worked on out-of-distribution detection (in computer vision).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2022 from the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University.
