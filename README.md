## Hi there 👋

I am Sudarshan Regmi. I am an independent researcher based in Nepal. My research interests broadly revolve around trustworthy machine learning. In the past, I have worked extensively on Out-of-Distribution Detection. My two recent solo-author works are: ASCOOD (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10794) and AdaSCALE (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08023).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2022 from the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University.
